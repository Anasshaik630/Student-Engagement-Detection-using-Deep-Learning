1. Importing the Packages
2. Exploring the Datasets
	- Student Engagement Data
3. Image Data Augmentation
	- Re-scaling the Image
	- Shear Transformation
	- Zooming the Image
	- Horizontal Flip 
	- Reshaping the Image 
4. Function for calculating the Recall, Precision and F1 Score
5. Defining the EarlyStopping to avoid either Under/Over Fitting
6. Calling the Model
	
	- CNN
	- MobileNet
	- Xception
	- NASNetMobile
	- Xception + NASNetMobile


7. Building and Training the model  
8. Dumping the best model for classifying the engagement


FrontEnd
--------

9. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
10. For the frontend we used the data for classifying 
11. User uploads an image
	- Classification
12. The given input is preprocessed for classifying 
13. Trained model is used for classifying and detecting
14. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use CNN and MobileNet models for classify the engagment of students,
As an extension we have applied NASNetMobile + Xception for analysis the dataset, 
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
